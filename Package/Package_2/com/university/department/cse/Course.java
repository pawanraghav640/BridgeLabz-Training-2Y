		System.out.print("B.Tech., or Bachelor of Technology, is a four-year undergraduate academic degree in engineering and technology, typically divided into eight semesters.\r\n"
				+ " It is designed to provide students with a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical, industry-oriented skills across various technical domains such as computer science, mechanical, civil, electrical, electronics, and emerging fields like artificial intelligence and data science.\r\n"
				+ " The program emphasizes experiential learning through lab sessions, projects, internships, and industrial training, preparing graduates for technical careers in diverse industries.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Eligibility for B.Tech. programs in India generally requires completion of 10+2 with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as core subjects, with a minimum aggregate of 50% to 60% marks, though top institutions like the IITs may require higher percentages.\r\n"
				+ " Admission is primarily based on performance in national, state, or university-level entrance exams such as JEE Main, JEE Advanced, MHT CET, KCET, VITEEE, and others.\r\n"
				+ " Some private colleges also offer merit-based or direct admission routes.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "The course fee varies significantly, ranging from ₹1 to ₹3 lakhs per year in government colleges to ₹5 to ₹10 lakhs per year in private institutions.\r\n"
				+ " Graduates can pursue higher studies such as M.Tech, MBA, MS, or research, and are sought after by top recruiters including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple, ISRO, and BHEL.\r\n"
				+ " Average starting salaries for B.Tech graduates range from INR 3 to 12 LPA, with experienced professionals earning between INR 15 to 20 LPA or more, particularly in high-demand specializations like AI, Data Science, and Cybersecurity.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "In addition to the standard four-year program, lateral entry options are available for diploma holders in relevant engineering fields, allowing them to complete the course in three years by entering directly into the second year.\r\n"
				+ " The B.Tech degree is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in India and is comparable to a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in the United States and Europe.");
